parameters: rdi rsi rdx rcx r8 r9 xmm0,xmmo1..xmm7
preserve:   rbx rsp rbp r12 r13 r14 r15
scratch:    rax rdi rsi rdx rcx r8 r9 r10 r11
return:     64-bit rax, 128-bit rax+rdx
Optionally, functions push rbp such that the caller-return-rip is 8 bytes above it, and set rbp to the address of the saved rbp. This allows iterating through the existing stack frames
